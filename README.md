# Fake-news-detection
This project is based on analysis and classification of news on Twitter using an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and RF (Random Forest) to Identify fake news or not. 

Developed using python pythainlp for Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow, pandas with WordCloud, Sklearn and Seaborn for visualizations. 
# Dataset
1.  Fake news : Fake.CSV
2.  Real news : Real.CSV
3.  manual_testing.CSV is a file that merges the two files together by categorize fake news for class 0 and Real news for class 1. 
# Libraries
1.  pythainlp
2.  numpy
3.  sklearn
4.  matplotlib
5.  seaborn
6.  wordcloud
8.  nltk
9.  warnings
# Neural Network 
Random Forest

# Test procedure
1. Clone the repo to your local machine 
2. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed 
3. Use FakeNews-RF-and-LSTM.ipynb to test 

# Model Used and accuracy  
  * Accuracy----73% for LSTM and 79% for RF
